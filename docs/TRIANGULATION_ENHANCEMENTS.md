# Enhanced Multi-Mouse Triangulation Features

## Overview
The 3 Blind Mice application now features advanced triangulation algorithms that provide intelligent, smooth, and responsive multi-mouse control.

## Key Features

### 1. Weighted Averaging
- **Dynamic Weight Assignment**: Each mouse is assigned a weight based on its activity level
- **Active Mouse Prioritization**: Mice that are actively being used receive higher weights
- **Inactive Mouse Degradation**: Mice that haven't been used recently have their weights reduced
- **Smooth Transitions**: Weight changes are gradual to prevent jarring cursor movements

### 2. Activity Tracking
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks the last activity time for each connected mouse
- **Timeout Detection**: Mice inactive for more than 2 seconds have reduced influence
- **Automatic Recovery**: Mice become active again immediately when used

### 3. Position Smoothing
- **60 FPS Smoothing**: Applies smoothing factor based on time delta for fluid movement
- **Jitter Reduction**: Eliminates micro-movements and jitter from multiple inputs
- **Responsive Feel**: Maintains responsiveness while providing smooth motion

### 4. Screen Boundary Clamping
- **Safe Movement**: Ensures cursor never moves outside screen boundaries
- **Edge Handling**: Gracefully handles movements that would exceed screen limits

## Technical Implementation

### Weight Calculation
```swift
// Reduce weight for inactive mice
if timeSinceActivity > activityTimeout {
    mouseWeights[device] = max(0.1, (mouseWeights[device] ?? 1.0) * 0.9)
} else {
    // Increase weight for active mice
    mouseWeights[device] = min(2.0, (mouseWeights[device] ?? 1.0) * 1.1)
}
```

### Position Fusion
```swift
// Calculate weighted average of mouse movements
var weightedTotalX: Double = 0
var weightedTotalY: Double = 0
var totalWeight: Double = 0

for (device, delta) in mouseDeltas {
    let weight = mouseWeights[device] ?? 1.0
    weightedTotalX += Double(delta.x) * weight
    weightedTotalY += Double(delta.y) * weight
    totalWeight += weight
}

let avgX = weightedTotalX / totalWeight
let avgY = weightedTotalY / totalWeight
```

### Smoothing Application
```swift
// Apply smoothing to position updates
let timeDelta = currentTime.timeIntervalSince(lastUpdateTime)
let smoothing = min(1.0, timeDelta * 60.0) // 60 FPS smoothing

let newX = fusedPosition.x + CGFloat(avgX)
let newY = fusedPosition.y + CGFloat(avgY) // Normal Y axis

// Apply smoothing
fusedPosition.x = fusedPosition.x * (1.0 - smoothing) + newX * smoothing
fusedPosition.y = fusedPosition.y * (1.0 - smoothing) + newY * smoothing
```

## Performance Benefits

### Before Enhancement
- Simple averaging of all mouse inputs
- Equal weight for all mice regardless of activity
- No smoothing, leading to jittery movement
- No boundary checking

### After Enhancement
- **Intelligent Weighting**: Active mice have more influence
- **Smooth Movement**: 60 FPS smoothing eliminates jitter
- **Boundary Safety**: Cursor stays within screen limits
- **Responsive Feel**: Immediate response to active mice
- **Graceful Degradation**: Inactive mice don't interfere

## Use Cases

### Collaborative Design
- Multiple designers can work simultaneously
- Most active designer has primary control
- Smooth handoffs between users

### Gaming
- Multiple players can control the same cursor
- Active player maintains control
- Smooth transitions during player switches

### Accessibility
- Multiple input devices for different users
- Automatic focus on active user
- Reduced interference from inactive devices

### Education
- Multiple students can participate
- Teacher can take control when needed
- Smooth classroom interactions

## Configuration

The enhancement is automatically enabled and requires no user configuration. The system adapts to:
- Number of connected mice
- Activity patterns
- Screen resolution
- User interaction frequency

All parameters are optimized for typical use cases and provide a balance between responsiveness and smoothness.
